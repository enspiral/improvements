# Improvements

This is a place for tracking improvements at Enspiral. The lifecycle of an improvement is

### Backlog
This is where an improvement starts. It could be a question, a problem or an idea to make things better. It could bea quick note or a lengthy treatise.

### Scoping
When a ticket moves to scoping it must have someone assigned to it. This person is a heroic individual who has the energy and vision to understand the improvement in depth and takes responsibility for finding a way forward. They do not have to commit to completing the improvement, just scoping and defining it. Once they are satisfied the improvement is scoped it moves to Ready.

Once a month the Catalysts sweep the 

There are two ways of interacting with the data

* The [raw github interface](https://github.com/enspiral/improvements/issues) is the best place for advanced searches. Checkout the [advanced github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) for search tips.
* [Waffle](https://waffle.io/enspiral/improvements) is the best place to get an overview of improvements in progress

Github issues are like a wiki, which means everyone can create or edit issues or change their status. Be careful on the Waffle board as moving a card will update its status.

##Keeping it fresh

Each two weeks the Catalysts will sweep the improvements list and apply the following filters
* Any issue in the backlog that is older than three months and not moving forward is closed
* Any issue that has been in scoping for more than a month is unassigned and moved to the backlog
* Any issue that is ready and hasn't been picked up for a month is moved to the backlog
* Any issue that is in progress will be prompted for a status update, if they didn't respond to the last prompt then it is moved to the backlog
* Any issue in review will be commented on and closed
