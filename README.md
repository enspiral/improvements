# Improvements

This is a place for tracking improvements at Enspiral.

There are two ways of interacting with the data

* The [raw github interface](https://github.com/enspiral/improvements/issues) is the best place for advanced searches. Checkout the [advanced github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) for search tips.
* [Waffle](https://waffle.io/enspiral/improvements) is for all those kan ban / trello addicts out there who love their columns and a good way to see what's current.

Github issues are like a wiki, which means everyone can create or edit issues or change their status. Be careful on the Waffle board as moving a card will update its status.

##Improvement lifecycle

### Backlog
This is where an improvement starts. It could be a question, a problem or an idea to make things better. It could be a quick note or a lengthy treatise.

### Scoping
Occasionally a heroic individual will emerge from the fog and take responsibility for an improvement. An individual with the energy and vision to bring clarity to chaos, the wisdom to seek advice from their peers and the silvery tongue of a poet to make long sentences short.

They do not commit to doing the work but they do clarify and scope the improvement so that others can. Once everything is clear the scoper can gaze boldly towards the horizon, utter a meaningful "my work here is done", and stride off into the sunset. The ticket moves to Ready.

### Ready
Like a puppy locked up inside the improvement languishes in the ready column just waiting for someone to come home and play with them. All they really want is be outside running and jumping and rolling in the grass. Or some food, any food, but especially those sweet cobudget dollars. 

But instead they are sitting here in a cold and dark concrete bunker. Alone and waiting for someone to love them, their big saucer eyes gazing falornely at all the strangers on the internet who give them the once over and think "not today". 

Until that someone special arrives.

### In Progress
So much wow! Fireworks, magic, "oh my god this is really happening". Idea meets team. Documents are written, money moves, Loomio decisions fly and circles of hands raise towards the heavens with fingers sparkling. Ones turn to zeroes and zeroes turn to ones in their billions. People even talk to each other.

Until everyone gets a little bit tired and it's time for a nap and a serious discussion about how it all went.

### Review
We share stories and learn from each other about what was, what could have been and what might be next time.

### Done
Well, that was all terribly exciting. An adventure that will be etched in the tickets comment thread forever (or until the internet shuts down).

##Keeping it fresh

Each two weeks the Catalysts will sweep the improvements list and apply the following filters
* Any issue in the backlog that is older than three months and not moving forward is closed
* Any issue that has been in scoping for more than a month is unassigned and moved to the backlog
* Any issue that is ready and hasn't been picked up for a month is moved to the backlog
* Any issue that is in progress will be prompted for a status update, if they didn't respond to the last prompt then it is moved to the backlog
* Any issue in review will be commented on and closed
